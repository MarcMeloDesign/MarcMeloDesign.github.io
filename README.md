Website for my typography class. Through the use of Html, Css, and Javascript I was able to create a 1 page scrolling web site. I Also put alot of thought into my font and font size as well as color. IIt contains an animated Logo, a short gallery of my work an about me snippet and a Resume. The challenging parts where are actually deicing on what I wanted to website to be. Orignally I had seperate webpages. However I consider myself a minimalist and like the flow and ease of a one page website. And then deciding on a final color scheme. I may ulitmately come backe and revisit this project after learning more javascript.
